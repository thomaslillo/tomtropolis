                Currently, a Software Developer at <a href="https://environicsanalytics.com/">Environics Analytics</a> in Toronto where I'm working on our backend, building new APIs with .NET Core, and doing some cloud/big data work.
                In University, I co-founded a data science conference+workshop company called <a href="https://thomaslillo.github.io/datathon-website-tailwindcss/">Datathon Analytics Events</a>, teaching students to code and connecting them with industry. See an article about it <a href="https://brocku.ca/brock-news/tag/datathon/">here</a> or the <a href="https://thomaslillo.github.io/datathon-website-tailwindcss/">old website</a>.
                In my free time I work on <a href="https://wovenmining.ca">Woven Mining</a>, where I used machine learning to turn data and documents into insights for the metal mining industry.
